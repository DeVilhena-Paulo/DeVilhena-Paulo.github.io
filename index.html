              We introduce a type system that provides strong types for exception
              tracking in languages in the ML family.
              Our type system employs a rich notion of row polymorphism and subtyping
              to ensure backwards compatibility, making sure that code without exception
              tracking remains to work and can be generalized gracefully to support
              exception tracking.
              We study the safety and abstraction guarantees of our type system,
              in particular the role of local exceptions for data abstraction.
              We formulate these claims using binary logical relations in a novel
              relational separation logic for exceptions, an independent contribution of
              this paper.
              We support a realistic subset of features from ML, such as extensible
              variant types and local exceptions, both of which are not supported by prior
              type systems and logics with exception tracking.
              We exercise our type system and logic on a number of challenging examples
              taken from the OCaml standard library, from one of Jane Street's OCaml libraries,
              and from Filinksi's PhD thesis.
              All our results are mechanized in the Rocq prover using Iris.

                Effect handlers offer a powerful and relatively simple mechanism
                for controlling a program's flow of execution. Since their introduction, an
                impressive array of verification tools for effect handlers has been
                developed. However, to this day, no framework can express and prove
                <strong>relational properties</strong> about programs that use effect handlers
                in languages such as OCaml and Links, where programming features like mutable
                state and concurrency are readily available. To this end, we introduce
                <strong>blaze</strong>, the first <strong>relational separation logic</strong>
                for effect handlers. We build blaze on top of the Rocq implementation of the
                Iris separation logic, thereby enjoying the rigour of a mechanised theory
                and all the reasoning properties of a modern fully-fledged concurrent
                separation logic, such as modular reasoning about stateful concurrent
                programs and the ability to introduce user-defined ghost state. In addition
                to familiar reasoning rules, such as the bind rule and the frame rule, blaze
                offers rules to reason modularly about programs that perform and handle effects.
                Significantly, when verifying that two programs are related, blaze
                <strong>does not</strong> require that effects and handlers from one program be
                in correspondence with effects and handlers from the other. To assess this
                flexibility, we conduct a number of case studies: most noticeably,
                we show how different implementations of an asynchronous-programming
                library using effects are related to
                <strong>truly concurrent</strong> implementations. As side contributions,
                we introduce two new, simple, and general reasoning rules for concurrent
                relational separation logic that are independent of effects:
                a <strong>logical-fork rule</strong> that allows one to reason
                about an arbitrary program phrase as if it had been spawned
                as a thread and a <strong>thread-swap rule</strong> that allows
                one to reason about how threads are scheduled.

                Programs written in C/C++ often include <strong>inline assembly</strong>:
                a snippet of architecture-specific assembly code used to
                access low-level functionalities that are impossible or
                expensive to simulate in the source language. Although inline
                assembly is widely used, its semantics has not yet been formally
                studied.
            <br>
                In this paper, we overcome this deficiency by investigating the
                effect of inline assembly on the <strong>consistency semantics</strong> of C/C++
                programs. We propose the first memory model of the C++ Programming
                Language with support for inline assembly for Intel's x86 including
                <strong>non-temporal stores</strong> and
		<strong>store fences</strong>.
		We argue that previous
                provably correct compiler optimizations and correct compiler
                mappings should remain correct under such an extended model and
                we prove that this requirement is met by our proposed model.

	        We apply program verification technology to the problem of
	        specifying and verifying automatic differentiation (AD)
                algorithms. We focus on define-by-run, a style of AD where
                the program that must be differentiated is executed and monitored
                by the automatic differentiation algorithm. We begin by asking,
                <strong>"what is an implementation of AD?"</strong> and
                <strong>"what does it mean for an implementation of AD to be correct?"</strong>
                We answer these questions both at an informal level,
                in precise English prose, and at a formal level, using types
                and logical assertions. After answering these broad questions, we focus on a
                specific implementation of AD, which involves a number of subtle
                programming-language features, including dynamically allocated mutable state,
                first-class functions, and effect handlers. We present a machine-checked proof,
                expressed in a modern variant of Separation Logic, of its correctness. We view
                this result as an advanced exercise in program verification, with potential
                future applications to the verification of more realistic automatic
                differentiation systems and of other software components that exploit
                delimited-control effects.

                We consider a simple yet expressive &lambda;-calculus equipped with references,
                effect handlers, and dynamic allocation of effect labels, and
                whose operational semantics does not involve coercions or rely on type
                information. We equip this language with a type system that supports type and
                effect polymorphism, allows reordering row entries and extending a row with
                new entries, and supports (but is not restricted to) lexically scoped
                handlers. This requires addressing the issue of potential aliasing between
                effect names. Our original solution is to interpret a row not only as a
                permission to perform certain effects but also as a
                disjointness requirement bearing on effect names. The type system guarantees
                strong type soundness: a well-typed program cannot crash or perform an unhandled
                effect. We prove this fact by encoding the type system into a novel Separation
                Logic for effect handlers, which we build on top of Iris. Our results are
                formalized in Coq.

                This thesis addresses the problem of reasoning about programs that
                modify the heap and alter the control flow through effect handlers,
                a novel programming construct that provides a relatively simple interface to
                delimited control. This ability to manipulate the control flow is extremely
                powerful: many programming features &mdash;
                such as asynchronous programming and coroutines &mdash; that come as
                built-in packages of traditional programming languages can be expressed in
                terms of effect handlers.
             <br>
                The status of effect handlers as a modular and expressive programming
                construct is attested by the development of the OCaml programming
                language, which will have support for handlers in its next major release.
             <br>
                This event makes the problem of unveiling the logical principles that govern
                effect handlers even more pressing. In particular, how to reason abstractly
                about a continuation, rather than thinking concretely as a fragment of the
                stack? Moreover, can we reason separately about a program that performs
                effects and a program that handles these effects? This thesis answers these
                questions by introducing Hazel, a separation logic for effect handlers, built as an
                extension of Iris. Hazel introduces a novel specification language by means
                of which one can describe the behavior of programs, including continuations.
                The logic allows one to compose specifications in a modular fashion through
                familiar reasoning rules, such as the bind rule and the frame rule, and novel
                ones, such as the reasoning rules for handling and performing effects.

            <div class="abstract">
                User-defined effects and effect handlers are advertised and advocated as a
                relatively easy-to-understand and modular approach to delimited control. They
                offer the ability of suspending and resuming a computation and allow
                information to be transmitted both ways between the computation, which
                requests a certain service, and the handler, which provides this service. Yet,
                a key question remains, to this day, largely unanswered: how does one
                modularly specify and verify programs in the presence of both user-defined
                effect handlers and primitive effects, such as heap-allocated mutable state?
                We answer this question by presenting a Separation Logic with built-in support
                for effect handlers, both shallow and deep. The specification of a program
                fragment includes a protocol that describes the effects that the program may
                perform as well as the replies that it can expect to receive. The logic allows
                local reasoning via a frame rule and a bind rule. It is based on Iris and
                inherits all of its advanced features, including support for higher-order
                functions, user-defined ghost state, and invariants. We illustrate its power
                via several case studies, including (1) a generic formulation of control
                inversion, which turns a producer that "pushes" elements towards a consumer
                into a producer from which one can "pull" elements on demand, and (2) a simple
                system for cooperative concurrency, where several threads execute
                concurrently, can spawn new threads, and communicate via promises.

                That any field admits an algebraically closed extension
                is a fundamental theorem in modern mathematics.
                Despite its central importance,
                we believe that the result has never been formalised in a proof assistant.
                Here, we fill this gap by documenting the accomplishment of its formalisation in Isabelle/HOL.
                As auxiliary contributions,
                we elaborate on the difficulties that impeded this development
                and the solutions that we found.

                We verify the partial correctness of a <strong>local generic solver</strong>, that is, an
                on-demand, incremental, memoizing least fixed point computation algorithm.
                The verification is carried out in Iris,
                a modern breed of concurrent separation logic.
                The specification is simple: the solver computes the optimal least
                fixed point of a system of monotone equations. Although the solver relies on
                mutable internal state for memoization and for <strong>spying</strong>, a form of dynamic
                dependency discovery, it is apparently pure: no side effects are mentioned in
                its specification.
                As auxiliary contributions, we provide several illustrations of the use of
                prophecy variables, a novel feature of Iris; we establish a restricted form of
                the infinitary conjunction rule; and we provide a specification and proof of
                Longley's <strong>modulus</strong> function, an archetypical example of spying.
