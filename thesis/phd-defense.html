<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
Effect handlers form a powerful programming concept offering a
relatively simple interface to delimited control: a program fragment
that <em>performs an effect</em> is suspended and reified as a
<em>continuation</em> that, when invoked, resumes the paused
computation. Although the mechanistic behavior of effect handlers and
many interesting applications are well-documented, an important
question remains to be addressed: what are the <em>logical
principles</em> that govern effect handlers? In particular, how to
reason abstractly about a continuation, rather than thinking
concretely as a fragment of the stack? Moreover, can we reason
separately about a program that performs effects and a program that
handles these effects? This thesis answers these questions by
introducing Hazel, a Separation Logic for effect handlers, built as an
extension of Iris. Hazel introduces a novel specification language by
means of which one can describe the behavior of programs, including
continuations. The logic allows one to compose specifications in a
modular fashion through familiar reasoning rules, such as the bind
rule and the frame rule, and novel ones, such as the reasoning rules
for handling and performing effects.
