I'm a PhD student under the supervision of François Pottier.
We are interested in devising methods for reasoning about computer programs with rigour:
how to write a precise documentation of their behavior and how to prove that such specification is met.
In particular, we study programs that both manipulate the heap and alter the control flow through
a recent and exciting programming construct, an *effect handler*.
