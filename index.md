I'm a PhD student under the supervision of François Pottier.  
We are interested in devising methods for reasoning about computer programs with rigour:  
how to write a precise documentation of their behavior and how to prove that such specification is met.  
In particular, we study programs that both manipulate the heap and alter the control flow through a  
recent and exciting programming construct, an *effect handler*.
